        <h2 class="hSlide">Experience With Starting HTML</h2>
      </article>

      <p class="Git">
        When starting to learn about HTML I was excited as I love coding and
        learning how to use different languages as it is my first-time coding
        with HTML. With any new language is it kind of easy to start to learn as
        almost all coding languages are very similar therefore it was simple
        enough to get the hang of it quickly as I start learning coding from
        Delphi in high school which is a harder language to learn first? Just
        the only part that usually changes and which I need to get used to is
        the syntax of the language as I usually always end up confusing
        different languages or putting a semicolon where it should be and end up
        with an error. with HTML I see it is rather used to describe the
        structure and content of a web page to create. Overall starting html was
        exciting and fun to see all the different kinds of things I could create
        for a webpage to develop a website. I just need to keep practicing
        remembering the syntax that goes with HTML to avoid looking for small
        errors which can go away with a comma or semi-colon.

      <h2 class="hSlide">Reading: Lawson</h2>
      <p class="Git">
        Through Bruce Lawson's article on "Why you should choose HTML5" from
        when I started using HTML you can understand how supports why you should
        use HTML. This is because its users use other languages like CSS and
        JavaScript to provide information and perform extra coding functions to
        effectively construct a webpage. Through his article, I can see how HTML
        can be used for dynamic and adaptable change in a website like using
        "Section" to organize the coding page and separate paragraphs and code
        which is helpful to understand you have place code. It shows me how HTML
        is effective to organise a coders page to keep everything in order.

      <p class="Git">
        The history of the internet is fascinating and complex, there are a
        series of milestones and developments that have transformed the way we
        live, work, and communicate. The internet was first developed in the
        1960s as a means of connecting computers and sharing information between
        nodes, for only certain industries but change it develop to allow use by
        other industries. Then in the early 1990s, the world wide web was
        developed allowing for the creation of easily accessible web pages and
        opening the Internet to a wider audience. Just understanding and viewing
        the history of the internet shows how it has had a profound impact on
        our lives we communicate and connect with others to work and access all
        kinds of information. I find the history of the internet interesting to
        see how the internet has changed over the years and how it continues to
        shape our world, I look forward to how it will further evolve and impact
        my life and others.
