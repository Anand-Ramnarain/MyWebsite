      <p class="Git">
        Continuing with my website I have seen how important it is to create
        wireframes. Otherwise, I'd have to build my website just out of my head
        and this does not work out as there are multiple ways in which the site
        can look and it is hard to choose which way to do it. I started off
        drawing my wireframes on paper to try and get an idea in mind of how I
        wanted my website to look, then I remade it on my computer which allowed
        me to rethink some of my ideas and clean up the layout so that it is not
        too complicated. Alongside, my wireframe I have been thinking of
        different ways to display items, like a secondary nav bar which will be
        able to scroll or give a drop-down option. I have gone through the video
        for displaying items to give me a way to code them.

        Reading: Gibson
      </h2>
      <p class="Git">
        Gibson’s article "Alternative Approaches to Interface Technology."
        explores different ways in which interfaces can be designed and
        experienced, beyond the traditional graphical user interface (GUI) that
        was prevalent at the time. Gibson’s argues that GUI Gibson argues that
        GUI is limited in its ability to fully engage. with users and create
        immersive experiences This is agreeable to an extent as GUI on certain
        site are dull and ineffective but others can take you on a journey,
        looking at mythic games website is simple but through the use of GUI and
        effect it takes the user on a journey through the website as it they are
        experiencing it. Gibson’s article made me think about the different
        approaches to interface technology, and how to use the interface to
        create forms of engagement, interaction, and communication. It made me
        think of using the UI, UX and graphics to immerse the user into the
        website so that they can find a better understanding of themselves.

      <h2 class="hSlide">Wireframes</h2>
      <p class="Git">
        The readings and the lectures have helped me further my wireframes. As
        my wireframes were messy and very vague in the sense that I even got
        confused about what I wanted to put in a certain place. The readings
        have helped me recognize I need to only use key information as too much
        will overwhelm and confuse the users and too little will make it so they
        don’t know what is happening. This week's lecture has helped me identify
        that I need systems that will allow the user to go to the top of the
        page automatically. I had never thought about how tedious it would be to
        scroll from the end of a long page back to the top. Another fact I had
        to consider was the Navigation bar. As you can overload this nav bar
        with too many options or pages but rather have fewer which can take the
        user to a different page with more options as it would overwhelm the
        user with a lot of options to choose from.
