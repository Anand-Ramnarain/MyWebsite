      <p class="Git">
        This was my first-time using GitHub and setting it up. I didn’t
        understand how it works but after going through the tutorial and YouTube
        videos, I think I understand how to use GitHub to save my progress and
        have it there if anything were to go wrong, as it is also a way to share
        and view code with multiple people. It seems like more of an effective
        way to send in code for an assignment than the files which sometimes
        don’t even open.

      <h2 class="hSlide">Reading: Bush - As We May Think</h2>
      <p class="Git">
        Bush’s reading was eye-opening in the way in which he looks at it from a
        futuristic perspective. He outlines a vision for the future of science,
        technology, and information management. He made accurate predictions of
        how technology is going to advance, and because of this, his ideas laid
        the base for many technologies created today, like hypertext, the
        internet, and the World Wide Web. For example, the hyperlink, which
        allows users to jump from one document or webpage to another, was based
        on Bush’s theory. Along with his prediction, he also suggests
        information is becoming like “growing mountains” as there is so much
        information that it overwhelms him. This part I related to as with the
        advancement from his work information has even grown larger as you can
        get from anywhere in the world now, but I understand that through all
        the information if we must be able to choose how and which one to
        interact with. Bush’s ideas are still used today and almost everyone
        directly or indirectly, through how he explains rapid selection, to add
        one sheet to an operator and within seconds others can add in their
        notes, and it can be suggestive to others. When reading this I just
        looked at my computer screen and saw I was doing that as I had other
        tabs open which I can view to gain a better perspective on the reading
        to further understand and get my conclusions. Bush’s reading just
        creates an awareness of how the possibilities of the past became the
        present and can still be developed in the future to become even more
        effective. Overall, "As We May Think" continues to shape our
        understanding of the possibilities of technology and its potential to
        transform the way we live and work as it has a profound influence on the
        development of technology and people.

      <p class="Git">
        My goal for this course is to be able to further understand different
        coding languages and the elements used towards designing a website so
        that I feel confident to design my website.
