        During this week, I was focusing on the small aspect of my website as
        well as all the bugs that I came access while going through the website.
        This includes a scrolling bar by my nav bar and for my main page. As it
        allowed both sections to scroll down which then allowed my nav bar
        section to be blank. The aspect in which I focused on was the movement
        between certain pages. As some of the pages allow for a smooth
        transition to the other. These small aspects allowed me to get closer to
        my goal alignment.

      <h2 class="hSlide">Reading: Hassenzahl & Tractinsky</h2>
      <p class="Git">
        In their article, Hassenzahl and Tractinsky provide an overview of the
        concept of user experience and propose a way to advance it. They argue
        that the user experience is multidimensional. This indicates that each
        aspect such as emotions, controls, behaviour, and context plays a role
        in how the user interacts with the website. They also emphasize the
        importance of UX, to rather show it as interactive products, services,
        and environments for the user. One key point that stood out to me is the
        subjectivity and dynamic nature of UX. They point out that UX is not
        just a matter of usability or functionality. Meaning that on my website
        the user experience relates to the userâ€™s perception and goals they wish
        to complete on my website. Overall, I found the reading to be insightful
        in the exploration of the concept of UX and its importance in design to
        the user. Its emphasis on the dynamic and subjective nature of UX made
        me consider the importance of considering users' perspectives and
        experiences in designing the systems of the website.

        I am still working on certain aspects of the website as the transitions.
        As I noticed my interaction on my website is far weaker compared to
        others. I explored different options on how to implement and effectively
        achieve this, thus allowing me to achieve my goal for the website.
      </p>
      <p class="Git">
        Goal Alignment- My goal for my website is to give my users an experience that
        has easy navigation with effect interface so that the user can
        seamlessly move through the website to where they want to go to.
      </p>
      <p class="Git">
        Information Structure- I want to make the information structure clear
        and simple by spreading my information across multiple pages thus the
        user can select the page they see the necessary information. I am still
        working on certain aspects of the website as the transitions. As I
        noticed my interaction on my website is far weaker compared to others. I
        explored different options on how to implement this.
