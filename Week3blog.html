        It is very exciting to learn CSS and to see how goes in hand with HTML
        to create and design a visually aesthetic website. The lectures helped
        me engage with the content in a way that allow me to code alongside to
        effectively understand the work without losing track of what is
        happening. The lecture showed me how there are different methods in how
        to code with CSS and HTML, which helps in understanding different
        aspects of the code that I use instead of just using and copying one
        method all the time as there may be a more effective method to use. The
        lectures were interesting in how they showed how I must be able to
        design a website take can be used on multiple different types of
        platforms. This made me reconsider my ideas for the website to be
        viewable a phone and computers.

      <h2 class="hSlide">Reading: Mailoux</h2>
      <p class="Git">
        In the reading, Mailloux explores the relationship between language
        conventions and the context in the interpretation of language. Alongside
        with the lecture it highlights how to decide which UI and UX to use, we
        must first gather how successful it is then it can become a convention.
        Mailloux defines convention as suitable practices commonly used in a
        context. (Mailloux 1983: 399). Indicating how conventions in UI and UX
        must be agreed upon and used as a base for it to be a convention. When
        understanding UI and UX conventions as a creator we must look at how the
        user will react to it and how they feel about it. Thus, the interaction
        between the user and UI/UX is what is important as that feedback and
        response is the convention. As if the user can interact with it
        successfully then it has become the convention but if not, I must go
        back to the wireframe and find a new UI/UX that can successfully for
        full it to become the convention. An example is the previous and next
        buttons, these buttons are at the end of the page, allowing the user to
        go straight to the next one. It would be ineffective to put them at the
        top as then the user has to scroll up again to go to the next page. It
        shows how UI and UX conventions have become limiting to new ideas. This
        is because the user becomes used to UI and UX conventions as it may not
        allow them to experience a new way of how it can be done. Since it is a
        convention the user will always want something similar to that and may
        leave your website if it does not meet that convention.
